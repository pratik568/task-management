In the provided code, a JavaScript object called priorityOrder is used as a data structure to define
the priority levels of tasks. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation:

Data Structure Used: Object
Purpose: The priorityOrder object maps task priority levels (high, medium, low) to numerical 
values (1, 2, 3). This allows for easy comparison during sorting.

Key-Value Pairs:

Keys: Strings representing priority levels ('high', 'medium', 'low').
Values: Numbers that represent the order of priority (1 for high, 2 for medium, 3 for low).
Sorting Logic:

The sort function compares the numerical values associated with each task's priority. 
By subtracting the values, tasks are sorted in ascending order of priority (higher priorities come first).
